Once upon a time, there was a dog that met spider-guy. This duo 
decided to travel to the moon. Although, they had not a single
idea how to get there. Then the light bulb struck and the 
ideas starting flowing. Dog's first idea was to stack 
legos together all the way to the moon. Once attempted,
the legos blew apart with a big gust of wind. Darn, the 
lego tower seemed like it should have worked! Spider-guy 
then though that a large trampoline could help them jump up 
to the moon. The team hopped onto their favorite shopping 
application and ordered the largest trampoline listed. They 
opted to pay extra for instant delivery.
